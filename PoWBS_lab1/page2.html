		<h1 id="top">Age of Empires II</h1>
		<a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/" target="_blank"><img src="res/AoeII/AoEIICover.png"></a>
		<p>A game that is a whopping <em>20 years</em> old and still going strong in some sense</p>
		<p>And with its 20 years, is a Definitive Edition being released later this year!</p>
		<p>The Definitive Edition aims to improve aspects of the old game as well as reintroducing old mechanics such as Civilization bonusses</p>
		<a href="StartPage.html">I took a wrong turn, get me back!</a>
		<h2>Civilizations</h2>
		<p>The game with all its expansions consist of <strong>32</strong> different civilisations, all with their own unique units and bonusses</p>
		<p>The expansions and their civilizations are structured in the following way</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><b>The Age of Kings</b> <i>(Core Game)</i></dt>
			<dd>Britons</dd>
			<dd>Byzantines</dd>
			<dd>Celts</dd>
			<dd>Chinese</dd>

			<dd>Goths</dd>

		</dl>
		<p>Every civilization has its own favorable and unfavorable matchups, and sometimes even the map type itself can change a previously unfavorable match into a favorable one</p>
		<h2>The Competetive Scene</h2>
		<p>The competetive scene for the game is still going, though not as strong as its rival game Starcraft II</p>
		<p>Still it manages to gather a noteable following, with pro players from all over the world playing against each other in different tournaments</p>
		<p>Noteable players are the current number one in the wolrd <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/theviper">TheViper</a> from Norway and another top 10 player also from Norway <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/mblaoc/">MbL</a></p>
		<p>Other noteable names are Liereyy, TaToH, Hera, JorDan, FatDragon, and Mr.Yo</p>
		<p>I couldn't find streams for everyone so mention by name alone will have to do</p>
		<p>If one would rather watch pro games with casters as well as more casual <abbr title="Age of Empires II">AoE II</abbr> content, head over to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/t90official">T90Official</a>'s stream</p>
		<p>He is one of the biggest <abbr title="Age of Empires II">AoE II</abbr> content creators at the moment, and arranges community games as well as the pro tournament "Hidden Cup"</p>
		<p>He is most well known for the <em>Forrest Nothing</em> map where the entire map is covered by trees, and the players will have to chop their way to each other to attack or trade for resources, as well as free up space for building structures.</p>
